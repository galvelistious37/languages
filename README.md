I have decided to learn to speak Tagalog and Spanish. This project will consist of digital flashcards which a user can click on to reveal the english value of a Tagalog/Spanish word a phrase. This is a great opportunity to combine my programming skills into a real world application which can increase programming and spoken language skills. More details to come.
