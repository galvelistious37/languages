I have decided to learn to speak Tagaloc and Spanish. This project will consist of digital flashcards which a user can click on to reveal the english value of a Tagalog/Spanish word a phrase. This is a great opportunity to combine my programming skills into a real word application which can increase both programming and spoken language skills. More details to come.
